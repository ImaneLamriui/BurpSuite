### Enhancing Web Security User-Agent Manipulation with Burp Suite
In the context of __Burp Suite__, __'User-Agent'__ refers to an __HTTP header__ used to identify information about the browser or client making a web request. 

This header provides __details__ about the browser type, version, and, in some cases, the user's operating system. 

It is part of the information sent by the browser to the web server so that the server can tailor its response based on the client. 

It's common for some websites to customize their content based on the __User-Agent__ received in HTTP requests. 

Websites may use this information to adjust their content and presentation according to __the type of device or browser__ accessing the site.

In the context of __web security testing__, professionals often modify the __User-Agent__ to assess how a website responds to different browser configurations or devices and to uncover __potential vulnerabilities__ or __security issues__.
